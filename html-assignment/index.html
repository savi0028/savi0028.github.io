    <h2>About Me</h2>
  </article>
  <p>
    My name is Raven Saville and I am an Interactive and Media Design student at Algonquin College. So far I am enjoying
    all of my classes, esspecially this one.
    My hope in completing this program is to build a skill set that will alow me to bring any information to life in a
    visual way; all of my dream projects
    revolve around this concept.
  </p>
  <h2>Some of My Dream Projects:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Illustrate a Childrens Book</li>
    <li>Create/Design an <abbr title="application">app</abbr></li>
    <li>Animate Something</li>
    <li>Design Infographics</li>
    <li>Create my Own Font</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    There are going to be way more projects added to that list over time and I am excited that I will be able to
    complete
    some of these projects in the near future.
    My parents are going to be <em>so</em> proud when they see that I coded this all by myself! Heck! I'm proud!
  </p>
